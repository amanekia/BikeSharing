## BikeSharing


# Overview 
In this project we were tasked with analyzing the bike-sharing program by citi bike in New York City to see if it is feasible to open a bike sharing program in Des Moines. We were tasked with creating visuals using Tableau to answer the following question that the investors had:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

# Results
We used the public data available at the NYC Citi bike website for the month of August, 2019 as it is warmer during that time and can give an accurate represenation of how the bike sharing program is used. 

The first data we pulled out was the following:

From the data above we can gather that more than 3/4 of the users are subscribers, which means they are regular users of the program. Also it shows how more than 60% of the customers are male.

The second visualization that we created is as follows:

This graph shows the number of trips by duration and we can see that most trips last under an hour, with majority of them being within the 30 minute mark. 

The third visualization that we created is as follows:

This graph shows the number of trips by duration but breaks it down by gender. Again we can see the the bike sharing program is predominantley used by males.

The fourth visualization that we created is as follows:

This is a heatmap that shows the usage of the bikes during the week by hour. From this map we can see that majority of the bikes are used during the weekdays at prime commuting hours, mainly from 7am - 9am and 5pm - 9pm.

The fifth visualization that we created is as follows:

<img width="969" alt="Screen Shot 2023-03-02 at 10 55 07 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44278585/222481278-44da580e-df32-4259-8621-b621cf877051.png">

This heatmap shows the usage of bikes during the week by hour but breaks it down by gender. Again we can see from this data that the majority users are males.

The sixth visualization that we created is as follows:

<img width="516" alt="Screen Shot 2023-03-02 at 10 57 12 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44278585/222481706-0e3e7940-74aa-4e0c-9d0d-1f6f2e9b80bd.png">

This heatmap shows user trips by weekday, but differentitates it by usertype (i.e customer or subscriber) and by gender. Again we can see that most of the users are male and are subscribers of the bike sharing program. 

The seventh visualization that we created is as follows:

<img width="948" alt="Screen Shot 2023-03-02 at 10 59 43 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44278585/222482432-78b9e40d-1fc4-4bf2-9af2-877e2a0fe8ca.png">

This graph shows the peak usaage hours of the bikes so we can know when to do repairs when needed. This graph tells us that majority of the bikes are used within the day time so the optimal time for repairs would be during 1 - 4am. 

# Summary

In conclusion, bike sharing services are very popular ecspecially in busy metropolitan areas. This may be due to a lot of traffic in those areas resulting in longer commute times, also a scarcity of parking which in turn makes people look for better options for their commute. Also the market is predominantley made up of male subsribers, so one thing to work on is how to attract more female subscribers.
